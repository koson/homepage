<p><b>Eryri/Snowdonia</b><br>
We are based in the mountains of Eryri (Snowdonia) North Wales and we stayed here because of the mountains, we are keen climbers and mountain bikers. Thanks to the internet we enjoy developing open hardware and software and running a technology business from here too.</p>
